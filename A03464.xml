            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Superſtition hath euer preuailed in the world, where Gods grace and light was wanting, to corrupt all the pure worſhip of God, but neuer ſo much abuſed any one exerciſe of religion as this of faſting. The very Heathens abuſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the worſhip of their falſe gods. The prieſts of Egypt euer abſtained from fleſh and wine, and thought this a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great deuotion. The wiſe men of Perſia, their diet was but <hi>farina &amp; olus,</hi> courſe bread and hearbes. The wizards of India, when they came to the prieſthood of the Sunne, did euer after abſtaine from fleſh. The prieſts of Egypt faſted <hi>3.</hi> dayes before they ſacrificed. So the diuell commandeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers to faſt three dayes before any magicall practiſe of coniuration. And to be ſhort, Mahomet extolleth fasting: for the Turkes faſted in the ſiege of Conſtantinople, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wonne the citie, aſcribe this great victorie to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.

<pb facs="tcp:4346:6"/> ſtrong lawes made to binde conſciences. The Popes ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did preach and write, that <hi>faſting was a worke to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and merite grace,</hi>

Rending of the clothes that is paſt, but rending of the heart that continues ſtill. For the firſt then, note the words of Chriſt, Matth. 11.21. <hi>Woe be to thee Chorazin, woe bee to thee Bethſaida: for if the great workes which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sydon, they had repented long agone in ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> For poore ſinners in their firſt conuerſion vnto God, are often ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed and caſt downe, that little ioye haue they to taſte any foode, and it ſhall be good for them not to doe it, as conſtrained, but the more to humble themſelues, and the more penitently, and effectually to pray and to cry for grace.

Eightly and laſtly, theſe men wee ſee had zeale to perſeuer and continue this holy exerciſe of faſting and prayer for many daies: and to continue their admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inſtructions and conference yet a longer time. For albeit the Lord heareth alwaies the prayers and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his ſeruants, in the very beginning: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he ſheweth not alwaies any full graunt of them long after, becauſe he would haue his children more earneſtly to ſue vnto him, by petitions and ſupplications, and to waite vpon him. So the Apoſtle admoniſheth, that wee perſeuer and continue in prayer, wayting and expecting with patience a bleſſing from the Lord. This Daniel tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs by his practiſe and experience: <hi>At the ſame time, I Daniel was in heauines for three weekes of dayes. I ate no pleaſant bread, neither came fleſh, nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint my ſelfe at all, till three weekes of daies were fulfilled.</hi> This was a patient perſeuerance in prayer, faſting, and humiliation, for 21. dayes, then hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth an anſwer. <hi>Feare not, Daniel: for from the firſt day that thou diddeſt ſet thine heart to vnderſtand, and to humble thy ſelfe before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</hi> Thus we ſee, that albeit the

Let vs remember how to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit our brethren, as here wee bee taught; and this exerciſe firſt remember alſo to practiſe, when thine owne houſe, or any in thine houſe is taken with any grieuous ſickneſſe, or vnder any ſpecial calamitie: So doth Dauid, 2. Sam. 12. Remember Iames: <hi>Is any ſicke? ſend for the elders.</hi> 2. And when our brethren are brought low with any grieuous ſickneſſe of bodie or minde, as wee heard in Iobs friends. And laſtly, this is the onely way to cure the great and dreadfull Sathanicall diſeaſes and euils, which no doubt vexe often many euen in theſe dayes, incurable to the beſt learned Phiſition. Of ſuch euils and their cure on this wiſe by faſting and prayer, we haue ſufficient inſtruction with Chriſt, Matth. 17.15. where note theſe poynts.

                           <p>BEfore the minde be inlightened with ſome meaſure of the true knowledge of God: there can be no faith, no repentance, no ſaluation: how can men loue that which they knowe not, how can wee truſt him whom wee loue not, &amp;c.

The Eunuch was very diligent in reading the ſcriptures, Act. 8. and the Apoſtle commaundeth his epiſtles to be read publikely and priuatly to all the ſaintes, 1. Theſ. 5.27. Col. 4.16. A diligent, wiſe and profitable reading of holy ſcriptures, helpeth iudgement, increaſeth faith, confirmeth memorie, ſtirreth vp affection, &amp;c. and prepareth a man wonderfully to the fruitefull hearing of Gods word preached. A great number not regarding this preparation, know not the preachers text, and many know not what booke or part of the bible, and ſome are ſo rude &amp; ignorant, that they know not whether the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, or apocriphall bookes be handled.

                        <p>FIrſt ioyfully praiſe God, and be thankfull for his fauour and mercie in Chriſt, giuing thee ſuch viſible ſignes and feales of his couenant, in ſubſtance the ſame, for the confirmation of his elect in all ages.

                        <p>And thus came the faithfull of elder ages to the word and ſacraments, as often as they could, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued great comfort by both.

                        <p>The laſt ſpeciall motiue and cauſe of this priuat exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of faſting in all religious families,<note place="margin">The 10. cauſe of priuat fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting for the Church.</note> vnto all Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people to the worlds end, is the publike ſtate, and for the good of Gods Church and people generally, as to preuent euils to come, to remoue preſent, or imminent dangers, &amp;c. For thſeſe cauſes are euident in many preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents wee finde in the Scripture. For euery true beleeuer and member of Chriſts Church, ought to lay to his heart
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4346:30"/> the miſeries of Gods people, and to feele them as if they light vpon his owne ſoule. So Eliſha doth, foreſeeing what euils ſhould come on Gods people: firſt he faſtened his eyes ſo long vpon Hazael, that Hazael was aſhamed: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">2. King. 8.11.12.</note> he wept for the Church, as for his owne priuat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: thirdly, he telleth bloodie Hazael what euill hee ſhould do vnto the people of God, firſt, fire their cities: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, put to ſword the ſtrongmen: thirdly, daſh in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the very infants: 4. And as voyde of all humanitie, rip vp, and rend in peeces their women with childe. And we may not doubt but as hee wept, ſo alſo hee faſted and prayed for the Church: for ſo did the Prophets and holy men in the ages following. Nehemias faſted, wept, and prayed himſelfe in his priuat chamber for the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the miſeries and deſolations of Ieruſalem in his time.<note place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> So did Ezra with a few well affected, weepe and mourne, &amp; hauing all day humbled themſelues in faſting, in the euening hee made a moſt worthie confeſſion of ſins vnto God for the Church in this forme and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: he fell vpon his knees and ſpread out his hands vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.5.15.</note> ſaying: <hi>O my God, I am confounded and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to lift vp mine eyes vnto thee my God: for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are increaſed ouer our head,</hi>

                           <hi>and our trespaſſe is grown vp vnto the heauen: from the dayes of our fathers haue we been in a great trespaſſe vnto this day, and for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities haue we, our kings, &amp; our priests been deliuered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Kings of the lands, vnto the ſword, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captiuitie, into a ſpoyle, and into confuſion of face as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth this day. And now for a little ſpace grace hath been ſhewed from the Lord our God, in cauſing a remnant to eſcape, and in giuing vs a nayle in his holy place, that our God may light our eyes, and giue vs a little reuiuing in our ſeruitude. For though we are bond men, yet the Lord hath not forſaken vs in our bondage, but hath inclined mercy vnto vs in the ſight of the Kings of Perſia, to giue vs life, and to erect the houſe of our God, and to redreſse the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4346:30"/> places thereof, and to giue vs a wall in Iudah and in Ieruſalem. And now our God, what ſhall we ſay after this? for wee haue forſaken thy commaundements, which thou hast commaunded by thy ſeruants the prophets ſaying: The land whereunto yee goe to poſſeſse it, is an vncleane land, becauſe of the filthines of the people of the landes, which by their abhominations, and by their vncleanenes haue filled it from corner to corner. Now therefore ſhall yee not giue your daughters vnto their ſonnes, neither ſhall ye take their daughters vnto your ſonnes, nor ſeeke their peace nor wealth for euer, that yee may be ſtrong and eate the goodnes of the land, and leaue it for an inheritance for your ſonnes for euer: and after all that is come vpon vs for our euill deedes, and for our great treſpaſſes (ſeeing that thou our God hast ſtayed vs from being beneath for our iniquities, and hast giuen vs ſuch deliuerance) ſhould we returne to breake thy commaundements, and ioyne in affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with a people of ſuch abhominations? Wouldest not thou be angrie towards vs, till thou hadst conſumed vs: ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor any eſcaping? O Lord God of Iſrael, thou art iuſt, for we haue been reſerued to eſcape, as appeareth this day: beholde, we are before thee in our treſpaſſe, therefore wee cannot ſtand before thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of it.</hi> Thus farre Ezra for the Church and ſinnes of the people of his time. So prayed Dauid, and faſted no doubt full often for the Church of God: for thus hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, Pſalm. 69.9, 10. <hi>For the zeale of thine houſe hath ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me, and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len vpon me,</hi> for this cauſe he addeth: <hi>I wept and my ſoule fasted.</hi> And as hee doth himſelfe, ſo hee exhorteth others:<note place="margin">2.

And ſurely faſting will drawe vs to a more earneſt ſearching, fight and feeling of our owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, and ſo to a deeper ſorrow and mourning for ſinne: for which cauſe the exerciſe which the other Euangeliſts call faſting,<note place="margin">Compare Mark. 2.20.

The people in Nehemias time, when they humbled themſelues in faſting, wept and mourned ſo exceedingly for their ſinnes, that the noble captaine by much intreating could not ſtay their weeping. So the Leuites which preached in euerie congregation (for the whole multitude was deuided into diuerſe aſſemblies) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon the people <hi>to ceaſe weeping and mourning.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Verſe 11. 1. Sam. 6.6.</note> And in Samuels time the people faſting and mourning for their ſinnes, wept ſo much, that they are ſaide to <hi>haue drawne whole buckers of water,</hi> which the depth of their ſorrow for their ſinnes, &amp; the anger of God againſt them had miniſtred. We reade often of Dauids teares. 2. Sam. 3.31.32. So likewiſe of Chriſtes weeping, Luke 19.41. Iohn 11. but of his laughter neuer.<note place="margin">2. Kin. 8.12.11. Act. 20.30.

And Ioſeph wept often, being occaſioned by his brethren,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.62. Luk. 7.38.</note> Geneſis 50.17. 43.30.45.1.2.14. Peter in his conuerſion wept bitterly: and Maries teares were ſo many,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 22.19.</note> that ſhe is ſayd to haue waſhed Chriſts feete with weeping. Ioſias heart melted, and wept before the Lord for his owne ſinnes and the ſins of his people. And the Pſalmiſt ſweetely teacheth what ioy followeth all the croſſes of the faithfull,<note place="margin">The teares of the faithfull haue a happie end.</note> if with ioynt hearts they weepe and mourne and cry vnto God. Pſalm. 126. verſ. 5.6. <hi>They that ſow in teares, ſhall reape in ioy: they went weeping, and carried pretious ſeede: but they ſhall returne with ioy, and bring their ſheaues.</hi> And thus wee ſee how the faithfull can ſhed teares plentifully for good cauſes, which aſſuredly are neuer loſt on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 56. ve. 8.</note> but bee regiſtred with the Lord, and preſerued <hi>as in his bottels.</hi>

                        <p>Secondly, they mourne alſo to conſider the euils which are imminent, and readie to fall vpon their enemies. Pſal. 35. verſ. 13.14. For this cauſe Dauid he faſted, wept, and prayed for Saul, when that tyrant ſought euery day to kill him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they weep for the Church of God, when Gods people are afflicted. Theſe bee cauſes of the teares of the faithfull. But ſuch as weepe onely becauſe of their owne plagues,<note place="margin">Teares of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</note> they are no better then dogges, for they will crye when they bee beaten, and the diuels alſo will rore when they muſt goe to hell, as we heare in the Goſpell.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, ſorrow and griefe of mind, as in Ezras time: becauſe the temple reedified was not comparable to the firſt: many in great griefe wept with a lowde voyce, Ezra. 3.12.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, great ioy of heart: example for this cauſe we finde in Ioſeph, who was filled with exceeding ioy when he ſaw his brother Beniamin: and this affection cauſed him to ſhed teares exceedingly: <hi>Ioſeph made baſte, (for his affection was inflamed towards his brother, and ſought where to weepe) and entred into his chamber, and wept there.</hi> Gen. 43.30.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, a vehement anger being a mixt affection, of ioy and griefe, cauſeth teares: for this euill affection doth reioyce in reuenge, and will otherwhiles breake foorth into teares for very griefe of minde, when it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Compaſſion and mercie draw teares from the godlyfull often, becauſe of their ſympathie and griefe they haue in the miſeries of their brethren. Ioh. 11. verſe 34.35.</p>

                        <p>This verſe teacheth vs: Firſt, what a hard matter it is to aſſwage the fire of Gods wrath, when it once breaketh foorth, when he ſtrikes with famine, warres, or peſtilence any ſinfull people. Surely in regard of our ſelues, becauſe we haue multiplied ſinnes againſt him, we haue cauſe to doubt he will neuer leaue vs till he hath conſumed vs. But when we conſider his promiſes, his goodnes, his Chriſt, his rich mercies in Chriſt, let vs not doubt, but ſend foorth cryes mightily vnto him: and aſſuredly wee ſhall finde
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4346:38"/> grace and comfort, if wee beleeue and repent. Conſider the generall and fearfull ſinnes of the land: and when the Lords wrath breaketh foorth into warres, plague, famine, or peſtilence, who can looke for any thing but that the Lord ſhould conſume, as hee hath done the rebels in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, where the Lords couenant is broken, the ſeales polluted and prophaned, his wonderfull name blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the holy Sabboths ſpent in the ſeruice of Sathan, Bacchus and Venus, and reſerued by vncleane beaſts,<note place="margin">The reuenger of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is ſent forth for theſe ſinnes.

Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the Lord our God being that gracious God, ſo ſlow to wrath, ſo full of bowels of mercie, as the Prophet hath before ſhewed, let Gods people, in their vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, bee well aſſured, they ſhall finde fauour and grace with God.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, here wee learne the chiefe care and deſire of Gods people, when they be truely humbled and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto God: namely, how the ſeruice and pure worſhip of God may bee maintained. For they are well aſſured, this is the chiefe piller and ſtay of all their good ſtate and welfare in this life, and Gods ſpeciall ordinance for their euerlaſting ſaluation. So ſoone as Aſa was deliuered, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled, and informed by Gods Prophet, he reformed his kingdome, and ſet vp the ſeruice of God.<note place="margin">2.

                        <p>Now the time is come vpon vs for to practiſe this holy doctrine of repentance, which the Prophet hath hetherto commended vnto vs in this exhortation: if we regarde it not, note the time of our viſitation, certaine it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhame and confuſion is reſerued for vs. Let vs not bee like the Atheiſts of Eſaias time, who when the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to faſting, weeping, and mourning, gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to eating and drinking, and feaſting, ſcorning his

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4346:39"/> generall faſt, &amp;c. Concerning this inſtrument, the diuerſe tunes, and meaſures which were to be obſerued in warres and peace, to call and to diſmiſſe the congregation, reade Num. 10. verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Where we may learne, verſ. 8. Firſt, that this was the prieſts office to ſound the trumpet, leaſt the people ſhould bee aſſembled raſhly without good cauſe, or vnaduiſedly without iudgement. Secondly, that the trumpets did ſerue for three ſpeciall vſes: firſt,<note place="margin">The diuerſe vſes of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.</note> to call the people or the heads of the people to the publike aſſemblies: ſecondly, to prepare and to warne them to bee ready for the warres: thirdly, to publiſh their feaſtes, and their ſolemne times for ſacrifice. Thirdly, if the captaines or chiefe heads onely aſſembled, they ſounded the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet but once onely, verſe 4. if the people aſſembled, they doubled the ſound, verſe 3. But for the warres they ſound <note n="*" place="margin">Or broken ſounde. The diuerſitie of ſounds in the trumpets.</note> alarums, verſe 5. Whereby is meant a more vehement and broken ſound, which is drawne long, and continued ſome ſpace of time. Among other great ſignes &amp; ſoundes that were heard on Sinai (when GOD himſelfe ſpake in that moſt ſtrange manner, the wordes of the holy lawe) there was heard to call the people, <hi>The ſound of a trumpet exceeding loude.</hi> Againe about the middeſt of September they had a feaſt, wherein was great ioye by ſounding of trumpets, to ſignifie their new yeare to be at hand, for then began their <hi>annus ciuilis,</hi> for buying and ſelling, for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and bondage, and then came in the tenth of that moneth their feaſt of <hi>Kippurim,</hi> of reconciliation, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And as the Lord commanded the holy prieſts to ſound the trumpets, ſo muſt they alſo and the Prophets bee the Lords trumpeters, to call vpon and to informe the princes of all cauſes and occaſions of ſounding the ſame. So the religious magiſtrates ſent forth their edicts into all partes of the kingdome, for the ſounding of the trumpet for ſuch ſolemne aſſemblies, as often as occaſion required. This we ſee in the good King Iehoſaphat: <hi>He feared God, and ſet himſelf to ſeeke the Lord, &amp; proclaymed a faſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                        <p>The magiſtrates are Gods vicegerents &amp; watchmen, as well as the Lords miniſters, and by this general name, the Prophets euer vnderſtand as well the one as the other.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The firſt cauſe of their meeting was, that the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4346:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> remembrance of Gods great and wonderfull benefites might neuer dye among them:<note place="margin">Vſe of the Paſſeouer.</note> therefore in the feaſt of the Paſſeouer, they did celebrate the remembrance of their miraculous deliuerance out of Aegypt: ſecondly, in the feaſt of Pentecoſt, the remembrance of the lawe and holy couenant which they receiued in Sinai: Thirdly, in the feaſt of Tabernacles, they were put in remembrance how they dwelt fortie yeares in the wildernes in tents, and were graciouſly preſerued, and thankeſgiuing was then vſed for their come and other fruites receiued. So they were yearely put in minde, of theſe three the greateſt bleſſings that can be in any commonwealth. For the firſt great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines of any weale publike, is to be freed from al bondage, to inioy freedome, and to haue ſpeciall liberties and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities graunted: this mercie the Lord ſhewed them in their admirable deliuerance from Aegypt. The ſecond thing which maketh a flouriſhing commonwealth, is that Gods lawes, and holy couenant be receiued, Gods pure worſhip and holy religion be eſtabliſhed. This was done by the Lorde in a moſt wonderfull manner vnto that people in the wildernes of Sinai. The third poynt to be deſired for the preſeruation of the happie ſtate of any people, is, that nothing to preſerue this preſent life be wanting: this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie alſo they receiued at Gods hand yeerely, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had receiued miraculouſlie in the wildernes fortie yeares, as the holy ſtories haue recorded. Secondly, they were in theſe generall meetings yeerely confirmed in their conſent in holy religion, and in the forme and manner of the pure worſhip of God. Thirdly, then the moſt godlie learned Prophets, Prieſts and Leuites, did aſſemble from all their colledges and ſchooles of learning to inſtruct the people of God, and to reſolue them in all their doubtes. Fourthly, by this generall meeting alſo, mutuall loue and affection did increaſe, and was euer confirmed among the Tribes, for then they feaſted and reioyced together. Fiftly, by this alſo the holy miniſterie and the place of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4346:41"/> was the better prouided for, and the Prieſtes and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites were incouraged in the ſeruice of the Lord, Deut. 12.6.7. 2. Chro. 31.4. Becauſe that great aſſemblie, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſacrifices and offerings in thoſe feaſtes. 6. Againe this ſerued for the confirmation of their faith in their ſupplications and prayers there: for the Lord had made a ſpeciall promiſe to his people in that place, Deuter. 12.28. 1. King. 8.7. And the Lorde woulde haue them by this trauell to teſtifie their obedience alſo vnto his lawes, for the place was appoynted by him, and ſtoode not in their own election, as is before ſhewed. 8. Laſtly, this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell was a notable exerciſe of their faith, for at that time they were to leaue their ſubſtance, albeit in danger of the ſpoyle by the enemie (for all the male-kinde of any ſtrength went vp to Ieruſalem) and ſo they did, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending all things to Gods holy protection. And yet we neuer reade that this people were euer in damaged by their enemies, by reaſon of theſe holy aſſemblies vnto the place of Gods worſhip, the times God appoynted: For the Lord moſt graciouſly according to his promiſe preſerued them and their land, Exod. 34.24. <hi>I will cast out the nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and inlarge thy coastes, ſo that no man ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the land, when thou ſhalt come vp to appeare before the Lord thy God thriſe in the yeare.</hi>

                        <p>The Iewes miſpent this daye many wayes: for when they were commaunded by their magiſtrates and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to aſſemble thus together for generall faſts, the carnal worldlings were glad of it, not to make it a ſolemne daye to the Lord, but for their own ſpeciall vſes.

                        <p>The fourth cauſe which ought to moue the religious magiſtrates and holy miniſters to proclayme a generall faſt is; if they ſee, finde, and can well diſcerne that ſome ſpeciall iniquitie or iniquities call for Gods heauie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hinder the Lords bleſſings in the land: A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table preſident for this, is that which the holy prieſt Ezra, and the noble gouernour Nehemias haue left vs in their bookes for the inſtruction of Gods people throughout all ages: for when as the Lordes houſe did not ſo proſper as good Zorobabel and the holy Prophets Haggai and Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie deſired. Theſe worthie watchmen of the Lordes houſe ſoone diſcerned what euills prouoked Gods wrath againſt his people: For whereas the Lord had giuen in charge vnto his people, that they ſhould not ioyne maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with pagans and infidels: yet they, a great number <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the Prieſtes, and Leuites, and the rulers and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had married with the Cananites, the Hittites, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezites, the Iebuſites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Aegyptians, and the Amorites.</hi> Which thing when Ezra vnderſtoode he mourned greatly, <hi>And all that feared the wordes of the God of Iſrael aſſembled vnto him:</hi> So they faſted and mourned, and confeſſed their ſinnes. And ſo prouided that the people forſooke their ſtrange wiues: the couenant was renewed betweene God and his people:<note place="margin">Note. Nehe. 8. &amp; 9. Verſe 1. cap. 10. ver. 28 29.30.31.32.

                        <p>We learne alſo a fift cauſe of this generall humiliation, to be the calamitie or miſerie of our brethren, neighbour Churches, being either exerciſed vnder the croſſe, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by warres, famine, or peſtilence. It ſeemeth vnto me that ſome ſuch like cauſe moued thoſe holy Prophets and teachers to aſſemble that noble congregation at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4346:44"/> (where the chriſtians proſpered beſt, and did firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly profeſſe the name of Chriſt) to this generall faſting, we ſpeake of: for it is moſt like by that which followeth in the ſame holy ſtorie, that they laboured mightely in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, ſupplication and prayer, both generally for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God diſperſed among the gentiles, and in ſpeciall manner alſo for the poore ſaintes afflicted in Ieruſalem: and the Lord graciouſlie heard them both: for the Lorde then mercifully prouided for the Iewes by Peter and his fellowes, and ſtirred vp the gentiles to ſhew bowels of mercy vnto them, in ſupplying their wants, by their often ſacrifices of brotherlie contribution. Againe it is ſtoried, that then he ſent alſo, thoſe two worthie inſtruments of his grace, Paule and Barnabas for the conuerſion and confirmation of the gentiles.

As the Church before named in Antioch, when they were to lay hands on Paul and Barnabas (after they were ſeparate and poynted foorth by the Lord, as is before ſhewed) Act. 13. verſ. 3. it is ſayd they faſted againe the ſecond time, <hi>and bleſſed them, and commended them to the grace of God,</hi> that the Lord might proſper their holie miniſtrie among the Gentiles.

And leſt that any ſhould doubt of the exception of ſome: hee giueth vs his minde in more ſpeciall termes, <hi>gather the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: q. d.</hi> my will is that you aſſemble the princes, the Magiſtrates, the prieſts, the prophets, and all the rulers of the people, what office ſoeuer they beare in Church or Common-wealth. The reaſons for their appearance and humiliation in this aſſemblie: firſt, for that they ſtande more guiltie then the reſt, for manifold ſinnes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both in regard of their offices and of their yeares. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for that their example is greatly conſidered, noted and followed of all ſorts of men. Thirdly, their counſell and helpe muſt be had, as for diligent inquiſition and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie, ſo for the puniſhment alſo of all capitall &amp; groſſe ſinnes, which are the cauſes of this great euill and generall calamitie.

                        <p>Secondly, he calleth alſo for the younger ſort, euen the tender infants ſucking the breaſts, for the Lordes wrath

And wee ſee this anger of the Lord readie to conſume alſo, beſides our children, euen all our ſubſtance, if wee humble not our ſelues when the Lorde calleth vs thereunto, Ionas chapter 3. verſ. 5, 6. Ezra 8.21. Againe, the Lord would excite a dull and froſen hearted people, to mourne and weepe, by ſeeing and hearing the teares and cries of their infants, that ſo they may bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if not, in regard of Gods fearefull indignation and iudgements, yet for naturall affection, to mourne &amp; weep, and humble themſelues before the Lorde. And this alſo concerning the children is commaunded, that they might inure and acquaint their children with good things, that they might in riper age loue and practiſe the holy exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of religion and pietie.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the holy Ghoſt yet proceedeth further, and will haue no ſortes of men excepted, but now they muſt all mourne without any exception, euen of the <hi>Bride and Bridegroome,</hi> when they haue greateſt cauſe of mirth, ioy, and comfort,<note place="margin">Deut. 24.5.</note> they muſt turne all to ſorrowe, faſting, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and mourning.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4346:45"/> with any buſines, but ſhall bee free at home one yeare, and reioyce with his wife which he hath taken.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when for the cauſes before ſhewed, Gods people aſſembled vnto this publike humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: there was nothing might priuiledge or free any man from this holy exerciſe.

Here was the preaching place, here Chriſt preached, and hence he caſt out the buyers and the ſellers, which abuſed that holy place of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Here was the altar of burnt offerings and place of publike and common prayers, 2 Chro. 15.8. and 2. Chro. 8.12.

                           <p>The ſecond part of the Temple was the court of the prieſts:<note place="margin">The ſecond part of the temple</note> for they onely came therein to burne incenſe and to pray.

And here were the tables of the ſhew bread, and the candleſtickes. Into this place went the prieſts to pray and to offer incenſe vpon the braſen <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 30.1.</note> Altar. And this dooth Zachary in his courſe: <hi>He went</hi>

                           <p>The third place or part of that great Temple,<note place="margin">The third part of the temple.</note> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sanctum ſanctorum: the holieſt place of all:</hi> Here the arke of the couenant was ſet, as Salomon commaunded the <note n="e" place="margin">1.

There were alſo thoſe goodly monuments, the braſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Aarons rod, and the pot of Manna before the Arke, as the Lord had commanded them <note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 16.34.35.

And theſe were the parts of this holy temple, which the Lord commaunded to bee made: Moſes calleth it the Lords Sanctuary, Dauid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the matter, &amp; Salomon his ſonne gaue it the forme, and built it in ſeuen yeares. Therein was the Lord dailie worſhipped in morning and euening ſacrifice, preaching, reading of Scriptures, prayer, &amp;c. The enemies which prophaned it, the Lord euer plagued them: as Antiochus who ſet therein <note n="h" place="margin">1.

                              </note> Craſſus did robbe and ſpoyle it, and afterwards became a man moſt infortunate and miſerable. In Veſpaſians time it came to vtter ruine and deſolation, and not one ſtone was left vpon another, according to the propheſie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus did labour mightily to ſaue it from the fire, but by no meanes could effect it. Ioſephus ſayth, the Romane ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did fire it the ſame moneth, and the ſame day the Babylonians had burnt it before. And that from the firſt building thereof in Salomons time, to the ſecond yeare of Veſpaſian, at which time it was vtterly deſtroyed, there had paſt 1130.<note place="margin">Ioſeph de bello.

                              </note> yeares, 7. moneths, and 15. dayes. And from the reedifying of it in Cyrus, and Haggeis time to this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deſolation, there were yeares 639. and 45. dayes. So farre Ioſephus.</p>
                           <p>Now for the place where Ioel would haue the prieſts to pray: he doth in our text charge them to pray <hi>betweene the porch and the altar,</hi> that is, the common altar of burnt offrings, that is, in the place of the publike prayers and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God. The Prophet would haue the prieſts to pray, where the people may beſt heare them and ſee them, that they alſo might pray and weepe with them. He ſpeakes neither of burnt offrings vpon the common altar, nor of burning of incenſe within vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the altar of incenſe, nor of praying apart there as Zachary did, &amp; the other prieſts in their courſe: but of publike praiers only. <hi>q. d.</hi> The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not your ſacrifices, they are abominable vnto him, <note n="l" place="margin">Hagg. 2.14. Pſal. 50.15.16. Pro. 21.27.</note> becauſe you your ſelues bee impious and euill which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them. Let him ſee your publique humiliation with teares and cryes: and let the prieſts confeſſe your ſinnes, and ioyne with them in your hearts, euery one aſſenting with his heart vnto their prayers, that in the end you may all ſound <note n="m" place="margin">Cor. 14.16.</note> Amen, as with one voyce, teſtifying that you beleeue and truſt the Lord hath heard your deſires, and their prayers for you.</p>
                           <p>So then briefly thus it is: The porch was the place of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4346:48"/> the people, and the altar reſembled the preſence of God himſelfe, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſacrifices were offered: the prieſts which were to ſtand betweene the porch and the altar, were liuely <hi rend="sup">n</hi> types of Ieſus Chriſt.<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. cap. 2. &amp; 5. &amp; 9. Doctrin.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>This place teacheth vs this much: that Gods holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters they are to ſtand alwayes betweene God and his people, and in ſpeciall manner then when his wrath is kindled, as in famine, in warres, and in peſtilence, ſtriuing with all their might by all good meanes to reconcile the Lord and his people by and through Ieſus Chriſt. Thus wee reade of Aaron, that he ſtood betweene the dead and the liuing, labouring to appeaſe Gods anger, when there dyed 14700.<note place="margin">Num. 16.45.49. Ezech. 22.30. Eſay. 59. ver. 16.</note> of a plague for their rebellion in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes. The Lord alſo teacheth vs the ſame thing, when he complaineth by his Prophets, that <hi>no man would offer himſelfe to ſtand in the breach of the wall, to ſtoppe the courſe of his wrath, which was alreadie kindled againſt his people.</hi> A notable preſident for this we haue in good Ezra, who in great griefe and ſorrow lamented in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall faſt, which was for the marriages with pagans, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Ezra. 9. cap. 3.4.5.6.</note> 
                              <hi>He plucke off the haire of his beard and of his head, and ſate downe aſtonied, doubting whether the Lord would not deſtroy them,</hi> becauſe of their grieuous ſinnes. <hi>And there came vnto him all that feared the words of the God of Iſrael: and in the euening hee fell vpon his knees, and ſpread out his hands vnto the Lord,</hi> &amp; ſo made an humble confeſſion of their generall and ſpeciall ſinnes, vnto God. So doe the Leuites in that publike faſt with Nehemias. They ſtand vpon pulpits of wood, verſ. 4. and ſo confeſſe their ſinnes, and pray for the people, verſ. 7.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4346:49"/> The miniſters of the Lord did not onely weepe, the godly well affected powred foorth teares in like manner, as we reade often. The Iſraelites being to fight againſt the Beniamites, for their great ſinne againſt the Lord: <hi>faſted, mourned,</hi>

The Lord loueth the teares of his Saints, hee puttes them in his bottell, they are all regiſtred with him. Dauid wept much and oftten:<note place="margin">Pſal. 56.8.</note> ſo Hezekias, Ezra, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe. And if wee conſider our ſinnes and our times, if they had one ſinne we haue tenne as great and as grieuous. Many buckets of teares cannot humble vs, nor ſerue to teſtifie our humiliation.

Was Ezra and his people ſo full of teares for that one ſinne of vnlawfull marriages with pagans? and ſhall not wee much more weepe, ſeeing that not onely our marriages are often as bad, or worſe? and other innumerable proude ſinnes raigne ouer vs. And did the Iſraelites ſo deepely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their ſinnes, when they were in daunger of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins? and ſhall not we as humbly ſeeke the Lord, ſeeing that ſo many bloudie enemies doe beſet vs round about, and daily waite and expect with great confidence our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This confeſſion is implied by Ioel in this word <hi>ſpare vs:</hi> for ſuch as ſpeake on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4346:50"/> calling for mercie, confeſſe their guiltines before the Lord.

Fourthly, Daniel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth in his confeſſion and ſupplication, the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Meſſiah Ieſus Chriſt: crying, <hi>Heare vs for the Lords ſake:</hi> that is, for the Lord Ieſus Chriſt his ſake. The ſame is vnderſtood by Ioel in the word ſpare vs: for God ſheweth no mercie, nor ſpareth any people, but in and through Ieſus Chriſt. Daniels ſweet words, ſo full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſo needful for imitation vnto Gods people in al ages,<note place="margin">Dan 9. ver. 4.</note> are theſe following. <hi>Oh Lord God which art great and fearefull, and keepest couenant and mercie towards them which loue thee, and towards them which keepe thy commandements: we haue ſinned, and committed iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and haue done wickedly, yea we haue rebelled, &amp; haue departed from thy precepts, and from thy iudgements: for we would not obey thy ſeruants the Prophets, which ſpake in thy name to our kings, to our princes, and to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c.</hi>

This was done in Nehemias great faſt, which was publiſhed becauſe of many grieuous ſinnes, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for their prophane marriages with Pagans.

And that the people were taught this day the word of the Lorde, it ſeemeth vnto mee, wee may learne alſo of Ieremie, chap. 36. 5 27. For when Ieremie had written his prophecies concerning that kingdome and the deſtruction of it, and was therefore reſtrained himſelfe from preaching (a generall faſt being proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med becauſe of the Babilonians their enemies approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) he ſent Baruch the ſcribe the day of their faſt to reade his propheſies, for that hee truſted Gods worde ſo read, might doe ſome good vnto that rebellious and ſinfull people. <hi>I am ſhut vp and cannot goe into the houſe of the Lord, Therefore goe thou and read the roule, wherein thou hast written at my mouth, the wordes of the Lord in the audience of the people, in the Lords houſe vpon the fasting day: alſo thou ſhalt reade them, in the hearing of all Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, that come out of their cities,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">It is like that they had ſo perſecuted the Prophets, that there was but little preaching at that time.</note> 
                              <hi>it may be that they will praye before the Lorde, and euery one returne from his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill way.</hi> Some part alſo of this time was ſpent in ſigne of their vnfained repentance in examining, cenſuring, &amp; puniſhing ſuch ſinnes as then raigned, and moſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored God, and in ſetting forth ſuch orders as might make
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4346:52"/> moſt for the edification and good gouernement of Gods people: for ſo it was in the faſt before mentioned in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemias time.

The like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie we finde Ioſh. 7 in Achans ſtorie.</note> and muſt yeeld vnto the cenſures and puniſhments inflicted vpon them.

The firſt kind was the mixture of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall diſcourſes, or vaine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful and vnprofitable philoſophy, with the pure word of God, verſ. 8. The ſecond was the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4346:56"/> mixture of the legall and leuiticall ceremonies with the Goſpell, verſ. 16.17.18.19. The third euill, was a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſuperſtition bred and brought into the Church by the traditions and doctrines of men, ver. 20.21.22.23. placing of holines, deuotion, remiſsion of ſinnes, and the worſhip of God in certaine kindes of meate, in faſting, abſtinence, &amp;c. Againſt this ſuperſtition and abuſe of faſting, he war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs by three arguments. 1. Such as be freed from the ceremonies of Gods law, ought not to beare the burthen of mens vaine ceremonies:<note place="margin">Ver. 20.</note> but you are freed from them by Chriſt in his Goſpell: therefore much more from the vnprofitable ceremonies of men. 2. For declaration of the propoſition, hee giueth vs ſome ſight of their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious traditions, and opinions in their owne words: firſt, <hi>eate not:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 21.</note> ſecondly, <hi>taſte not:</hi> thirdly, <hi>handle not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is this: The kingdome of Chriſt is ſpirituall,<note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> and doth not conſiſt in things which periſh: but meates and drinkes doe periſh with the vſing. Therefore his kingdome, his worſhip and ſeruice doth not conſiſt in theſe things.</p>
                     <p>The third argument: Wee muſt place no religion nor worſhip of God in obſeruation of mens traditions, nor in will-worſhip: but theſe be meere vaine traditions, ſowne by Sathan in the braines and minds of men. Therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd them.</p>
                     <p>Obiect. But theſe men which teach and practiſe this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting &amp; abſtinence, are wiſe, iuſt, holy, deuout, &amp; religious men, not ſparing their owne fleſh, for the mortification of their corruptions, for pleaſing of God, &amp;c.</p>

Vnder colour of wiſdome and holines, &amp;c. they decreed to keepe certaine ſet faſts, on certaine daies appoynted. 2. This faſt conſiſted in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from certaine meates which they commaunded no man ſhould eate, taſte, &amp;c. 3. They accounted this faſt a ſpeciall worke to ſerue and pleaſe God, being yet but their own will-worſhip, neuer preſcribed of God. 4. They taught men to hold it a matter of great holines, to defraud the bodie of the honour and refreſhing due thereunto.<note place="margin">The ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the 1.2. and 3. age came from one ſpirit of error, and differ little, but that in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the 2. doth exceede the firſt, &amp; the 3. farre ſurpaſſe them both.</note> So then theſe words ſerue to admoniſh vs againſt the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious faſts of all ages: albeit this Scripture was written principally againſt the Phariſees and Eſſees, blind aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to the trueth and the pure worſhip of God in the dayes of the Apoſtles.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4346:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> admoniſh him to repent,<note place="margin">1.

This last branch is continued to the 32. chapter,<note place="margin">3.

<pb facs="tcp:4346:66"/> himſelfe, and appealing to Gods high throne of iustice. This ſpeech alſo is continued from the 32. chap. to the 38. And there begins the fourth part of this booke,<note place="margin">4. Parte.</note> wherein the Lord himſelfe ſpeaketh. And whereas Elihu did bend himſelfe moſt againſt Iob, ſometimes peruerting and wreſting his very wordes, and ſometimes repeating what hee neuer ſpake, verie ſparingly &amp; lightly touching his aduerſaries: the Lorde on the other ſide, gratiouſly and fatherly reproueth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant Iob, and ſharply rebuketh all the reſt, teaching them to know his power, wiſdome,<note place="margin">5.

                  <p>Two ſpeciall queſtions are handled in this booke: the first is concerning the iustice of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God: <hi>Whether it ſtandeth with his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that the wicked proſper, and the godly bee afflicted in this preſent life.</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>whether we may wel iudge
<pb facs="tcp:4346:67"/> of the faith, religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, by their proſperitie &amp; aduerſitie in this preſent life.</hi> Theſe queſtions haue bred occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of great disputation, and griefe vnto the faithfull of all ages, Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>3. Iere. 15. Hab. 1.13. and cauſed infidels to blaspheme, Mal. 2.17. and 3.15. Theſe doubts are notably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued and anſwered in this ſtory: for the first, that wee must not ſearche into the ſtrange iudgements of God, but know as Iob teacheth vs, chapter 24. 1. that all times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for prosperitie and aduerſitie, for good and euill, are hid with the Lord, and wee must as Job dooth,<note place="margin">Cap. 39. 36. 37.</note> put our hand on our mouth, and adore his maieſtie in all his works and iudgements, being well aſſured that his will is and muſt be euer vnto vs the only rule of iustice, &amp; that his hand &amp; will gouerneth al the accidents, changes and chances of this preſent life. For the 2. the Lord teacheth vs alſo, neuer to iudge of the end, nor of the life paſt of the faithful, by their preſent miſeries: for it fareth with vs in our ſpiritual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bates with the fleſh and the deuill, as it doth with wraſtlers in the world: for among them we
<pb facs="tcp:4346:67"/> ſhall ſee often, ſome one neere caſt downe, and yet in the ende giues his aduerſarie the foyle. So is it in the ſpirituall battaile, Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may ſeeme cast downe, when desperat ſpeeches paſſe from them, as we ſee in Dauid. Pſalm. <hi>77.10.22.1.2.</hi> and Jerem. 15.20. and<note n="*" place="margin">Qui eſcente ad tempus in ipſo deitate, &amp; ſenſibus carnis, in horendo illo iudicio quod tum ſubibat, penitus occupatis, in illam petitionem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripuit.</note> Christ himſelfe crieth bitterly in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of death, and yet in the end they tread downe ſathan vnder feete. Rom. 16.20. VVherefore we must take heede how we cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure theſe (as the manner of ſome is) for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſathan &amp; the fleſh rage and ſtorme for a time, et God giueth his children in death it ſelfe, ſtrength to triumph ouer them by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ, albeit this is not ſo comfortablie manifested at all times to our eyes in this preſent world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we haue here in Job a ſingular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> preſident and direction for the gouernement of life: ſo farre ſurpaſſing all other instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the practiſe of a most diuine and religious man of God, can excell the morall precepts of the best learned men on earth. Chap. 1. and 29.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apostle Saint James doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4346:68"/> highly commended Iobs patience, chapter 5. And ſurely whoſoeuer ſhall well conſider his condition and place, his pietie and religion, and ſo take a view of his most ſtrange cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, hee ſhall ſee a man of inuincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and constancie, and ſuch a preſident for patience as could neuer be ſeene, J ſuppoſe on earth, excepting only in the ſonne of God Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ. Arguments to demonstrate this briefely are theſe.<note place="margin">1. Peter. 2.19.20.</note> First, Saint Peter ſaith, <hi>If when yee doe well, and ſuffer wrong, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable to God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What praiſe is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults you ſuffer it patiently?</note> Jf Job had been an euill man, or of that common ſort of indifferent men, his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience had been commendable in ſuch intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable afflictions: but beeing a man moſt rare for all piety and ſinceritie, an vnspotted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of the Lord, one that gaue himſelfe no rest in any ſuspition of ſinne, chapter 3. 26. his patience and courage must bee the more admirable, in ſuch extreame calamities. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Job was exceeding rich, chapter 1. 2. 3. and chapter 29. last verſe, it were much if a poore man ſhould ſo endure the heauie hand of God vpon him, for poore men are more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb facs="tcp:4346:68"/> with the miſeries of this life then the rich, or if being an vpſtart from beggerie to ſome highe pitche of dignitie he could bee content to bee debaſed &amp; brought to his lowe ebbe again. But a man flowing in wealth, in great honour and estimation in the worlde continually, all his life time full of prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to bee thus cast downe, all on a ſodaine: there must bee in ſuch a one, more then mans ſtrength to holde him vp, and to keepe him from desperation.<note place="margin">Iob ſtands with courage till they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his faith.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jf we deſire to know what wrought this courage, constancie, and patience in Job, the Apostle anſwereth, 2. Cor <hi>3.5. We are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke any thing:</hi> and againe, <hi>I am able to doe all thinges through the helpe of Chriſt, which ſtrengtheneth mee,</hi> Phillip. <hi>4.13.</hi> There do conspire against Job as in a league; ſathan, fleſh, friendes, wife, and all torment him, yet his courage was inuincible,<note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> till Christ left him a little to ſee his owne frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and corruptions, then ſeemeth he as quite broken for a time, as a man forlorne and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God.</p>

The Church of God was not lodged onely in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams and Iſaacs familie in their daies, no nor yet in Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs familie which followed, and was farre greater. It is apparant in the ſtorie of Geneſis, that the knowledge and feare of God, was not then quite worne away out of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4346:72"/> poſteritie of curſed Cham, euen in Egypt, and elſewhere thereaboute, as appeareth in Pharaoh, Abimelech, and Melchiſedeches ſtorie. They had ſome knowledg of God, and of the promiſed Meſſiah. But the Lord did more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelfe, and his will vnto Abraham, Iſaac, and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, then to any other in theſe daies, and God was better, and more purely worſhipped in their families, then in any other part of the worlde in that age: Iob followed after them, and did inhabite an other region. The people of God therefore in his time were not ſeparate from among the Gentiles. It is like that ſeparation beganne at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture and deliuerance from Egypt: conferre Exod. 12.48. Acts 13.17. for then hee aſſembled them before him in the wildernes, and made his couenant ſolemnely with them, ſpeaking in theſe words:<note place="margin">Exod. 19.5. 1 Pet 2.9. Pſal. 147.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:4346:77"/> note what men Sathan ſo murdered: not Epicures, <note n="*" place="margin">Sathan knew the wicked would ſoone take occaſion to exclayme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iobs chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> nor hypocrites, extortioners, &amp;c. as Iobs friends thought, but godly and religious perſons.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Note here the religious loue, and happie conſents of theſe good children mutually comforting one another. No doubt they were no ſmall ioy and comfort vnto their father. Adam had but two ſons, the one murdered the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Noah had three ſonnes, one mocked his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was accurſed. Abraham had two ſonnes, the one ſcorned and perſecuted the other. Iſaac had two ſonnes, the one hated and deſired to murder the other. Iacob had twelue ſonnes, ten would haue murdered Ioſeph, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully ſold him into a ſtrange countrey. Dauids chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren murdered one another, and hee had great griefe and ſorrowe by them all: the elder deſpiſe the younger, the younger enuie the elder. If ſuch holy men had ſuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked children, what maruell is it, that our prophane parents breed and bring vp ſuch a wicked generation?</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>Q.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4346:79"/> from the beginning of the world. They had their prieſtes and prophets,<note place="margin">Gen. 4 4. Heb. 11.4. The beſt thinges muſt be offered vnto God.

Againe, in the time of the great deluge, they knew a diſtinction and difference of cleane and vncleane beaſts, that is, as a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned interpreter ſaith right well, of ſuch beaſtes as might be offered, and not bee offered in ſacrifice vnto God: for Noah is ſaid euen then to offer a burnt offring vnto God.<note place="margin">Gen. 8.21.22.</note> But all this order of Gods worſhip and ſeruice then not written, nor Iobs time alſo which followed, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes more fully manifeſted and reuealed in Sinai, and written that Gods people might no more decline from the pure worſhip of God vnto ſuperſtition, and falſe wil-worſhip. And yet howe harde is it to bridle the diueliſh witte of man, but that ſtill they will worſhippe either falſe gods, or the true God in a falſe manner after mans inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherfore here is a moſt high commendation of Iob, that hauing not the worde written, but the knowledge of God and his worſhip by tradition and reuelation,<note place="margin">Iob. 42.5.</note> yet did he not decline from the true ſeruice and worſhip of God.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>It may be my ſonnes haue ſinned:</hi> Loue is not ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>thinketh no euill:</hi> yet notwithſtanding loue is watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Iob had no manifeſt cauſe iuſtlie to ſuſpect euill in his children; yet becauſe of the libertie that commonly is vſed in banquettings, he feareth leſt by infirmitie they might fall, therefore as a wiſe and a carefull father, hee makes all ſpeed to pacifie the Lords wrath with a ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And bleſsed God:</hi> that is, curſed God, or blaſphemed god, or thought any wicked thoughts, or inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded any way to diſhonour God. The Lorde would haue his people to be ſo farre from blaſpheming, and taking of Gods name in vaine,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that albeit they had a proper word wherby they could expreſſe this, yet had they rather vſe another which did not ſo ſound in the euill part.

                        <hi>In their heart:</hi> That is, at leaſtwiſe inwardly in their hearts and mindes, if not more. But if Iob had knowen it otherwiſe, he would ſoone haue broken all their feaſting, and would haue turned all their mirth by ſharpe correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into bitter mourning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And thus did Iob all thoſe daies.</hi> That is, hee did offer the aforeſayde burnt offring alwayes, when his children thus feaſted, how often ſoeuer they thus banquetted in the yeare.</p>

                        </label> is how carefully he doth watch his good time for holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and of al times delights moſt in the morning. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to moue vs to followe Iob herein are many. 1. The example of the whole church in general, both of the Iewes and of the Gentiles:<note place="margin">The morning, the beſt time for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Pſal. 5.3. pſal. 55.17.</note> They had their morning and euening ſacrifices: God commanded them to conſecrate the firſt fruites of the day for his worſhip and ſeruice. 2. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all holy religious men, as Dauid alwaies: <hi>Heare my voice in the morning O Lorde, for in the morning will I direct me vnto thee and I will waite.</hi> 3. It is a time when the ſoule and all faculties thereof, when the body and all ſenſes and partes thereof, are moſt freſh and moſt ſtrong becauſe of the nights reſt, and therefore beſt able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any dutie to God or man. 4. For the morning is a time, wherein the worlde and the affaires of this life, haue not foreſtallen and preoccupied our ſenſes, our hearts, minds, &amp; affections, &amp;c. &amp; therefore moſt fit then are we and able to performe any ſpirituall ſeruice vnto God. 5. It is the firſt part of the day, and therefore the beſt part and moſt worthie to bee conſecrate vnto God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We bee taught here alſo how to ſanctifie our ſelues and our families, that is, to prepare our ſelues with al reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4346:80"/> to the holy aſſemblies, to offer vp our ſpirituall ſeruice and ſacrifices vnto God.

                     <p n="3">3. In their ſacrifices, they were put in minde of many things for the confirmation of their faith and repentance: 1.

The ſecond branch is in the verſe following to the 12. verſe: wherein firſt the Lord giueth his ſeruant Iob his iuſt commendation in a gracious manner, verſ. 8. And ſecondly, Sathan doth oppoſe himſelfe againſt Iob, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently accuſing him of hypocriſie before the Lord, with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4346:81"/> all his might, verſ. 9. 10. 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now on a certaine day.</hi> That is ſay ſome,<note place="margin">Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        </note> when ſuch a feaſt came, or in one of theſe banketting dayes, Sathan came among the good Angels, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Rabbins how they gloſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this text.</note> Others ſay this was the firſt day of the yeare, wherein the Lord did as it were vſually keepe court, and take accounts of all things done the yeare paſt: theſe bee the gloſſes of ridiculous and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Rabbins. To be ſhort, by <hi>a certaine day:</hi> here is ment that very time wherein it pleaſed the Lord to reueale his will and euerlaſting decree vnto Sathan: for Sathan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knew it not, before hee was ſent of God to execute the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſonnes of God.</hi> In theſe words are vnderſtood the holy Angels: for wee haue the like 1. King. 22.19. in the ſpeech of Michah to Achab: <hi>J ſaw the Lorde ſit on his throne, and all the hoſt of heauen ſtood about him, on his right hand and on his left hand: and the Lord ſayd, who ſhall entiſe,</hi> or perſwade and deceiue <hi>Achab, that he may goe and fall at Ramoth Gilead? And one ſaid on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and another on that manner: Then there came foorth a ſpirit and ſtoode before the Lord, and ſayd, I will entiſe him: and the Lord ſayd vnto him, wherewith? I will goe out and bee a falſe ſpirit in the mouth of all his prophets: then he ſayd, thou ſhalt entiſe him, and ſhalt alſo preuaile: goe foorth and doe ſo.</hi> The Angels haue many names in Scripture. This name is common to them all with all the faithfull. Firſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.6. Ephe. 1.21.</note> for that their adoption and confirmation is by grace, and through Ieſus Chriſt, for he alone is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſonne of God: ſecondly, they haue this name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the excellencie of their nature: for they doe moſt reſemble God our heauenly father. So the faithful are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in many places, Gen. 6.2. Rom. 8.14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Came.</hi> Naturall bodies all moue and change place. So the ſpirits alſo are truly ſayd to goe and come from place to place, as they be ſent and called for by the Lord to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any thing. But in this place this verbe of mouing (as
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4346:82"/> that of ſtanding which followeth) are vſed familiarly, the Lord ſpeaking to our capacitie, becauſe we be weake and vnable to conceiue otherwiſe of ſpirituall things. For the trueth is this, there is no comming vnto God by motion: but when the Angels are ſaid to come vnto him and ſtand before him, thereby is meant they ſerue him and attend vpon him. He hath no ſuch need to call them to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent or aſſemblie: they are alwaies in his preſence where euer they bee, and hee can informe them concerning his will, and the execution thereof at all times. And yet it is not to be doubted he doth aſſemble them when &amp; where it pleaſeth him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That they might ſtand.</hi> By this ſtanding before the Lord, is meant the readines of the holy Angels, to execute the Lords will, and to performe all duties impoſed by the Lord vpon them. Their redines to obey the Lord, &amp; their true obedience, is notably commended, Pſal. 103. v. 20. <hi>Praiſe the Lord his Angels that excell in ſtrength, that doe his commandement in obeying the voyce of his word.</hi> The Lord hath no neede of their ſeruice, as princes and great men haue on earth: but by their ſeruice hee would teach vs, what is the inuiſible power, glorie, wiſedome, and maieſtie of our God, on whom ſuch glorious and mightie creatures as the Angels are, doe continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And Sathan alſo came among them.</hi> That is, like as the holy Angels they ſtand, goe and come to ſerue the Lord in their places, and all they ſerue him cheerefully in doing his wil: So Sathan alſo and wicked ſpirits, they are drawne albeit againſt their wil to the Lords preſence, to ſerue and obey him in the execution of ſuch things as the Lord ſhall pleaſe to giue them in charge to doe. And their ſeruice is here ſignified by Sathans comming into Gods<note n="*" place="margin">He is ſaide cap 2. ver. 1. to come to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that is, to waite as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Epe. 6. Iud. ver. 6.</note> preſence: not that wicked ſpirits haue any acceſſe to the higheſt heauens: for the Scripture ſayth, they be in this world and in hell onely, and chayned whereſoeuer they goe, as Saint
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4346:82"/> Iude ſpeaketh. And like as the Lord is comfortably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by his good ſpirit here on earth with his people, but in great terrors often with the wicked: ſo is it with good and euill Angels, his preſence and power is moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto the good Angels: but his face is terrible vnto Sathan, for the Lord curbs him, chaynes him, and limits him whereſoeuer he goes.</p>
                     <p>And whereas one ſpirit is here onely named in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, by this name Sathan: This manner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is vſed not that wee ſhould deeme that there are but few, for no man is ſaid to be poſſeſſed of a legion: but that we might vnderſtand how that wicked ſpirits haue as it were their kingdome, and haue ſo conſpired together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and man, and that they haue as it were one, their chiefe Prince and Lord, called therefore the God of the world, 2. Cor. 4.4. the prince of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, &amp;c. Eph. 2.2. This word here and elſewhere ſignifieth a ſworne enemie and a ſpeciall aduerſarie: and ſo hee is to Chriſt and his members, as here in ſpeciall we ſee againſt Iob.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15</note> And this was euer taught the people of God from the beginning.</p>
                     <p>This verſe teacheth vs: firſt, <label type="milestone">

                        </label> that nothing commeth to paſſe, here below vpon earth, whether for the good of the godly, or puniſhment of the wicked, but it is decreed firſt in heauen aboue. And here wee ſee how the Lord in his good time doth manifeſt his decrees, concerning all and euery one of his workes, vnto men and Angels, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, when he vſeth their ſeruice for the execution of his will. Let vs not bee diſmayed with the ſtrange euents of this life, howſoeuer they fall out, yet are they not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by chance or fortune, or conſtellation, &amp;c but by the moſt admirable decree and hand of our God. This did not Iob and his friends ſo well conſider, as they ſhould haue done,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Wee learne that the prouidence of our God is not tyed to any ſecondary cauſes: the heauens, the Angels good and euill, and all inferiour creatures, they doe all
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4346:83"/> ſerue and obey him, and he committeth not the care of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular thing, no not of the baſeſt and vileſt creature vnto any one of them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Wee haue here a good argument of the almightie power, and glorious empire of our God, who hath thus all Angels good and euill in ſubiection vnto him. They haue no authoritie nor power to effect any thing good or euill in this preſent world,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 21.27.</note> but by him and from him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We learne here, that the Lord whether he vſe good or euill Angels as his inſtruments (for they all ſerue him) yet all his workes are good, and wee ought euer with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to expect the good end of them.</p>

                     <p>WE may not thinke that there paſt ſuch a familiar ſpeech betweene the Lord and that vncleane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for the Lord as he needeth not that the Angels come and ſtand before him, becauſe he is euery where preſent, ſo he needed no ſuch queſtions.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sathan whence commeſt thou?</hi> He asked the like que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Adam: <hi>where art thou?</hi> Gen. 3.9. to humble him and to bring him to repentance: and of Cain: <hi>where is thy brother Abel?</hi> Gen. 4.9. to conuince him for his ſin.

The Lord ſayth, Iob is ſound: Sathan denyes it to his face, and ſayth he is a broken veſſell. This was his impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie in paradiſe, that he would ſo blaſphemouſly ſpeak

                     <p n="4">4. Let vs learne here of Sathan what witchcraft is, namely, the ſtretching forth of Gods hand vpon vs, or anie
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:4346:92"/> outward bleſſings giuen of God vnto vs: when wicked ſpirits are ſent with commiſſion from the Lord againſt vs, either immediatly by themſelues, or by the ſecret and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne practiſes of witches and ſorcerers. Wherefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine here we be warned by Sathan himſelfe, not ſo to caſt our eyes vpon theſe baſe and vile inſtruments of the diuell, nor vpon Sathan and his arts, but in all ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and miſeries to turne ſpeedily to the chiefe Lord, who hath ſent Sathan with this commiſſion againſt vs. Such as rage againſt witches, and ſcratch them, &amp; adiure wicked ſpirits, are much like our common hackſters and ſwearing ruffians, which when the Lord Maiors Sargeant ſhall arreſt, preſently they rage, ſweare, and driue at the Sargeant to kill him: whereas they ſhould labour rather to pacifie the chief Magiſtrate, and to ſatisfie lawes which they haue broken. Wherefore in theſe caſes let vs wearie the Lord with ſupplications and teares, till hee withdraw his hand from vs, or graunt vs ſome ſpeciall comfort to beare his fatherly corrections vppon vs. So doing wee ſhall auoyde many ſinnes, which the wicked ignorant people doe fall into by ſundry illuſions of Sathan, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by witchcraft. That one example of Saul is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, to warne and to inſtruct for euer all Gods people. Firſt in Samuels time he is a great profeſſor of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie religion: then after his death he doth renounce the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie word. 3.

                     <p n="7">7. Laſtly, here note diligently what the ende is of all Sathans practiſes, temptations, arts, faculties, and ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems whatſoeuer: his onely deſire is that God might bee blaſphemed by his elect people, that they renounce God, renounce the holy trueth, and pure religion. This Chriſt ſignifieth vnto Peter when he ſayth: <hi>Simon, Simon, behold
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4346:93"/> Sathan hath deſired to winow you as wheate.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 22.31.</note> And ſurely Sathan came neere him, &amp; gaue him many great wounds, and had not Chriſt mightily kept him, he had fallen away vndoubtedly from the liuing God.

                     </p>
                     <p>Sathan here conſiders what we are of our ſelues: wee be indeede fleeting and wauering as the water. But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than forgets or knowes not Gods power,<note place="margin">Sathan and all wicked men meaſure other men &amp; Iudge of other men by themſelues.</note> and the power of Chriſt, Phil. 4.13. dwelling in vs. Hee ſeeth it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles and hath experience of it in the faithful, and yet for all that he knoweth it not.

And out of all doubt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:4346:95"/> Iob was of exceeding grace and ſtrength, (as after ſhall appeare) that could ſo patiently beare all ſuch croſſes. This manner of proceeding wee ſee in the Apoſtles: firſt,<note place="margin">

                        </note> the Lord bridled the rage of their enemies: <hi>Feare came on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſoule:</hi> Act. 2.43. Secondly, Sathan had authoritie to caſt them into priſon, Reuel. 2.10. but not yet to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond menacings and threates, Acts 4.18. After all this Sathan receiues yet from the Lord greater libertie euen to murder, and to ſhed the bloud of Gods ſaintes, as of Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, Acts 7. firſt, and of Iames after, and ſo of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in that age and in the ages following, as the ſtories of the Church haue well and truly recorded: look as god dealeth or giueth vs of his owne ſtrength, ſo doth he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe vs with temptations, which thing we are ſure is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our profite, albeit otherwhiles the Lorde himſelfe only knoweth wherefore he tryeth vs. Thus the Lord wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth where he giueth greateſt graces: for like as a man can neuer ſhew ſuch workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip in a little ſhop, as in a large and great one, where he may haue ſtuffe &amp; ſtore of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c. euen ſo the Lord in his great works in Abraham and Iob, and the like: The Lord tryed them to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to the ende that when wee compare our ſelues with them, we maybe aſhamed, ſeeing we be not able to ſuffer any affliction, be it neuer ſo light.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is great difference between this commiſſion againſt Iob, and that which was granted againſt Achab.<note place="margin">Wherein, or in how many poynts the diuels co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Iob and Achab do differ.</note> There the prophet ſeeth the Lorde to ſitte as it were in a chayre of eſtate, and to ſpeake firſt himſelfe, <hi>Where ſhall J find a lying ſpirit to goe and deceiue Achab?</hi> So the Lord calleth for a fit inſtrument to execute iuſt vengeance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that hypocrite. Firſt, there we ſee then when the Lord meaneth to puniſh the wicked, he doth not expect ſathans motiues and perſwaſions, but preuenteth him: But when hee tryeth his children, hee permitteth Sathan firſt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them, for therein the deuil wearieth himſelfe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, note another difference betweene Iob and Achab: The
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:4346:96"/> Lorde there calleth for a ſpirite of deluſion to fill Achabs ſoule with errors,<note place="margin">It is a faire greater plague for a man to be blind and ignorant in his ſoule &amp; to be full of error &amp; an fidelitie as Achab and Diues was, and papiſts the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee full of botches &amp; boyls in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as Lazarus and Iob were.</note> and ſo to plague him ſpiritually: <hi>Who</hi> (ſayth the Lord) <hi>ſhall entiſe Achab, or perſwade and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Achab?</hi> A wicked ſpirit anſwered, I will entiſe him, I will goe and be a falſe ſpirite in the mouth of all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. There is no plague or iudgement ſent from God, and executed vpon men ſo dangerous, as theſe ſpirituall illuſions whereby vnconſtant and vnbeleeuing hearts and minds are caryed away by vncleane ſpirits. This plague is threatned for the long contempt and abuſe of Gods holy truth, <hi>Becauſe they receiued not the loue of the truth, that they might bee ſaued, therefore God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleeue lies, that all they might be damned which beleeue not the trueth, but had pleaſure in vnrighteouſnes.</hi> If ſuch as deſpiſe the pure light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bee giuen ouer to Sathans effectuall working, to bee confounded and amazed, Rom. 1.28. How much more they which deſpiſe that bright ſhining grace which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſaluation, ſee Tit. 2.11. Hebr. 2.5. Epheſ 4.18.19. Theſe bee the ſteps vnto the reprobate ſenſe, threatned ſo often vnto ſinners for the contempt of Gods holy trueth. And thus fearefully was Sathan ſent againſt Achab to plague him in his ſoule, but here is no ſuch thing granted vnto the wicked ſpirite againſt holy Iob. Let Sathan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour all our ſubſtance (if God ſo pleaſe) yet if the Lorde keepe our perſons in peace, let vs lifte vp pure hearts and hands to be thankfull vnto the almighty for his moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious clemencie.<note place="margin">Pray alwaies heartely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt illuſions of Sathan as did Agur: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue from me vanitie and lies.

                     <p>Queſtion. But Sathan ſmites alſo ſometimes the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their ſoules and minds, as well as in body &amp; goods?</p>
                     <p>Anſw. No doubt they are humbled often by wicked ſpirites ſent purpoſely from the Lorde to ſhake and buffet them leſt they ſwel with any ſpirituall pride. For this cauſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4346:96"/> the Apoſtle was ſpiritually exerciſed by Sathan, the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Sathan was ſent to buffet him (ſayth he) leſt hee ſhould glory in himſelfe or be exalted: and this meſſenger he calles <hi>a pricke in the fleſh,</hi> whereby I vnderſtand all the galles, greefes, and prickes in ſoule and minde,<note place="margin">2.

                     <p n="5">5.

The people of God muſt not follow the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and practiſes of the Pagans and Gentiles, neither in their mirth, nor in their mourning, neither muſt wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in mirth or mourning as they doe. For the wicked know no meaſure in mirth, nor haue any hope in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, 1. Theſſ. 4.13 Iob the holy ſeruant of God did follow the people of thoſe Eaſt parts in their mourning, hee did as they did, and according to his knowledge in thoſe times.

Neuer was this apiſh imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of examples more ſeene in the world then at this day. But let vs firſt heare God ſpeaking of this argument: Deut. 14.1.<note place="margin">The Gentiles did exceede in mourning: Ioſeph and his brethren mourne for their father Iacob 40 dayes but the egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians 70. Gen. 50.2 3.</note>

Theſe ceremonies and rites of the Pagans, the holy Ghoſt in the law forbiddeth, leſt his people ſhould faſhion and misfigure themſelues like the Gentiles, and ſo learne alſo their ſuperſtition. Examples of theſe practiſes we may finde many ſome in Gods booke. The hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Iewes when they faſted, <hi>they lookt ſowre, and did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure their faces,</hi> that they might bee ſeene and noted of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4346:106"/> men. The prieſts of Baal crying for helpe againſt Elias of their falſe God:<note place="margin">1.

Theſe things the Lord forbiddeth his people carefully in his holy lawes, Deuter. Iob hauing in his time no ſuch light of God to guide him in theſe ceremonies, followed the Gentiles in parte, in that cuſtome of, ſhauing the head: but hee thought the launcing and cutting of his fleſh no doubt to be againſt nature and againſt God, and therefore albeit he deeply ſorrowed, and had as great cauſe of ſorrow as euer had Iew or Gentile in this world, yet he abſtaineth from this wicked and diuelliſh practiſe of the Pagans.</p>
                     <p>We bee naturally inclined to follow their religion and ſuperſtition, whoſe liues and manners we follow. For this cauſe the Lord to withdraw the hearts of his people from the Pagans religion, would haue them not to faſhion themſelues outwardly in anything like them. The Iewes are threatned by Gods Prophet Zephaniah,<note place="margin">Strange faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s dangerous for Gods people.

                     <p>Neuer was there ſuch miſfiguring of head and face, neuer ſuch following of ſtrange attire in any age, in any part of the world as this day in this land. It is vncertaine what Gentiles and Pagans wee follow, but moſt certaine we follow neither the old nor late Chriſtians of this land, or any other countrey. There was in S.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4346:106"/> denied themſelues to be like other men, becauſe ſaid they, they had chaſtened themſelues for the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and they profeſſed themſelues to bee virgin Monkes, and in ſigne thereof they did weare long haire as virgins doe. I can but wonder what Monkes or Nazarites, or harlots rather, this prophane age followeth: Lais her ſelfe could not more whoriſhly attire her ſelfe, then ſome men and women doe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We learne of Iob,<note place="margin">Zach. 11.11.12. A wonderfull ſigne of the ſpirite of grace to be able to call vpon God and to praiſe him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme miſerie.

But hee is patient, which by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, can ſo moderate his affections and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that he will not ceaſe to glorifie and worſhip God as Iob dooth here, and can reſt vpon God quietly by the anchor of hope, howſoeuer hee bee toſſed with the waues of this preſent world.

The Apoſtles and Prophets did wade through many afflictions with the wonderfull ſtaffe of patience in their hands: yet S. Iames preferreth Iob be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all.

                     <p n="1">1.

A word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his place is like apples of golde and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſiluer.

Nowe his wife makes a faire preface for this purpoſe, therefore Sathan begins with her, for he is wel acquainted with the weaknes of this ſexe, and how fit they be to intrap and deceiue others: againe no iniuries ſo gall vs, as thoſe which proceede from our beſt friends. Laſtly, this woman bearing chiefe authoritie in that houſe, all friends and ſeruants muſt follow her example And ſo they did indeed, as appeares chap. 19. 14. 15. 16. 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The greateſt comfort vnder the croſſe, and that (as Iohn ſaith) which ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth all our enemies,<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4346:119"/> in bodie.

                     <p>The wicked doe thus ſcorne Gods people vnder the croſſe as hypocrites, and they haue no greater torment: Sathan vſeth it often againſt the faithfull, for hee knowes there is no meanes more effectuall to wound their hearts: Firſt, we ſee it in Dauid being viſited with ſome grieuous ſicknes, verſe 11. friendes ſtand a farre off, enemies talke wicked things and imagine deceite: theſe things grieued him ſore.

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 41.</note> 
                        <hi>and he that lyeth ſhall no more riſe.</hi> See (ſay they) what plagues are come on him for all his profeſſion. Secondly, in Chriſt, for he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as it were crying againſt this, pſalm. 22.17. <hi>I may tel all my bones, yet they behold and looke vpon me:</hi> meaning ſcornefully, as it was verified afterwards, the ſtorie recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it: Luk. 22.15. <hi>The people ſtood and beheld, and the rulers mocked him with them, ſaying, hee ſaued others let him ſaue himſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> But I take it his wife did not ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly practiſe againſt him: but being in an errour, as hee findes, ſhee <note n="*" place="margin">No greater torments to Gods people then to be ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for their religion, and for to be euill intreated euen of their famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar friends.</note> would perſwade him that his faith was not good, that he was not greatly ſound, becauſe Gods hand was now ſo ſtrangely ſent forth againſt him, &amp;c. It is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous thing for the godly to haue the wicked to ſcorn them and their profeſſion, as wee ſee in Dauid often. But if they be cenſured, miſdeemed, and ſpoken euill of by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it is the greateſt torment that can be to their ſoules: for they greatly deſire to pleaſe Gods people, Rom. 15.30.31.

Hee that cannot bridle it, is ſet on a wilde horſe backe. (4.) He ſits in a ſhippe which wants a rudder or a helme. (5.) An euill tongue like a flame burnes vp all, euen all the world, the diuell fires it. (6) He that hath an euill tongue, is full of ſinne. (7) The wicked mans tongue cannot bee tamed. (8) Full of deadly poyſon. (9) He cannot bee a faithfull man which hath an euill tongue. Bleſsing and curſing are contrary.</p>

                        <hi>And none ſpake a word vnto him</hi> They came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte him by ſpeech and prayer, but now they ſtand ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed as that they cannot ſpeake a word to him, but no doubt ſpeake much to God in their hearts.</p>

                        <hi>For they ſaw that his paine was exceeding great or did increaſe exceedingly.</hi> They kept ſilence for a time not only for the ſtrangenes of the euill, but alſo to ſee if his paine would any thing decreaſe, that ſo hee might the better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to their words: but all this time of ſilence they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great ſignes of loue: one cauſe therefore of their ſilence was, they waited for oportunitie and time to ſpeake, and herein they did well, Prou. 25.11. <hi>For a worde ſpoken in time, or a word ſpoken in his place is like apples of gold with pictures of ſiluer, &amp;c.</hi> Another cauſe was, they were of a doubtful iudgement concerning him, they thought verily God had forſaken him &amp; ſet marks of his anger vpon him. Therfore they doubted how &amp; what to ſpeak, as after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by their long ſpeeches and conference with him.</p>

And beſides this racke in his bodie, the ſilence and geſture of his friends did ſo torment his mind, that at the laſt he cries out in that bitter maner we ſee, ca. 3. like a man in frenſie, which through ſome grieuous ſicknes hath loſt his wittes.</p>
